\section{Implementation}

This pipeline was developed in MATLAB 2016b. Since the group consisted of four students, a Git repository was used to be able to work on different files simultaneously, and to enable version control.

\subsection{Pipeline overview}
As shown in \cref{img_flow_rough} the pipeline consists of three parts:
\begin{compactenum}
	\item Bootstraping
	\item Initialization
	\item Continuous operation
\end{compactenum}

	\caption{Overview flow chart}
	\label{img_flow_rough}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Options and parameters}
The pipeline was designed in a modular way. Key algorithms are abstracted into self-contained functions, as described in the pipeline overview. Next to this 'functional programming' approach all the tuning variables (e.g. number of keypoints, bearing angle thresholds, etc.) were centrally aggregated in a parameter struct.\\
For further insight please consult the function \code{loadParameters.m}.\\

In order to run the visual odometry two launch procedures where implemented:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item \textbf{Debug Mode:} For development and debug mode the main.m with default 		parameters can be executed. Numerous individual plots are displayed with insightful 		information about matching, inlier rejection and triangulation.
	\item \textbf{Simple GUI:} Out of performance reasons a more compact and user-friendly display of the pipeline output was created with a GUI designed with the Matlab GUIDE application, see figure \cref{img_gui}. Only the most crucial entities, like number of landmarks, are visualized for intuitive understanding.\\
\end {compactitem}

\textbf{How to run the GUI}
Please follow the steps below to run the visual odometry through the GUI environment:
\begin{compactenum}
	\item adapt dataset paths in \code{loadParameters.m}
	\item type into MATLAB command window: \code{gui\_simple}
	\item in \textit{Parameters} panel select dataset to run on and toggle respective radio buttons
	\item hit \textit{Run} to trigger the visual odometry\\
\end{compactenum}

Advanced parameter tuning can be achieved by changing the default parameters in \code{loadParameters.m}.

\subsubsection{Camera calibration}
Using the Camera Calibration Toolbox for Matlab\footnote{\url{www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/}} from Jean-Yves Bouguet (Caltech) the camera of the an iPhone 7 Plus was calibrated. A set of 17 calibration images where extracted from a calibration sequence filming a checker-board pattern from various angles.

		\label{img_calib} 
	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

The camera intrinsics parameters together with a fourth-order polynomial approximation of the radial-tangential distortion were calculated based on the assumption of the skew being zero. The exact values and error margins are to be found on the Github repository.\\

Given these calibration parameters the VO pipeline was also applied on self-generated datasets called \textit{Poly-Up} and \textit{Poly-Down}. Note, that no undistortion was performed, since testing showed it to be negligible.
