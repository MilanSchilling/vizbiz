\subsubsection{Bootstraping}
In order to pick reasonable image pairs for initialization an automatic procedure was implemented.\\
Since a good initialization relies heavily on the number of inlier keypoints a hard constrained on their minimum number of \code{min\_num\_inlier\_kp} = $600$ was set.\\

Two approaches were investigated:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item \textit{SSD matching + Baseline/Depth}:\\
	correspondence search via SSD on Harris features \& 8-point-Ransac for outlier rejection \& baseline/depth-ratio\\
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{C1\_baseline}{C1\_av\_depth} \geqslant min\_b2dratio = 0.1
	\end{equation}\\
	
	\item \textit{KLT + Bearing angle}:\\
	correspondence search and inlier selection via KLT tracking on Harris features \& minimum average bearing angle\\
	\begin{equation}
		av\_bearing\_angle\_deg \geqslant min\_av\_angle\_deg = 10
	\end{equation}\\

\end{compactitem}

The comparison showed a massively higher performance of the KLT tracker approach, this being orders of magnitude faster and yielding many more feature correspondences also over large distances. \cref{tab_boot_idx} depicts the index tuples retrieved through the second approach.

\subsubsection{? findCorrespondences()}
Todo: @Miro
%write one sentence about using either harris matching(SSD?) or klt tracking - any %different to findCorrespondences_cont()?

\subsubsection{eightPointRansac}
Todo: @Miro

\subsubsection{linearTriangulation}
maybe only 1 sentences - ``like in the exercise''

\subsubsection{bundleAdjust}
is here anything different then in the continuous bundle adjust?

\subsubsection{applySphericalFilter}
have a look at \cref{triang_cont}. Maybe put this up to here and make a cref there.
