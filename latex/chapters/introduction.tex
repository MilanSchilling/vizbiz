\section{Introduction}
During this mini project a monocular visual odometry pipeline was developed. This pipeline takes the consecutive gray-scale images of a single digital camera as input. 
The output of the pipeline is the position of the camera in relation to its initial position for each frame.
The pipeline is programmed in such a way that the Markov assumption is valid. This means that the current computation step is only dependent on the previous step. This reduces the required computation effort.
