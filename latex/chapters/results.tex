\subsection{Bootstrapping methods}
\label{sec_boot_results}
The comparison showed a significantly higher performance of the KLT tracker approach, this being orders of magnitude faster and yielding many more feature correspondences also over large distances. \cref{tab_boot_idx} depicts the index tuples retrieved through the second approach with \code{min\_num\_inlier\_kp} = $600$ being required.

When relaxing the minimum number of inlier keypoints allowed to reach the desired baseline/depth ratio of $10$ \% for the first and a bearing angle of $10$ degrees for the second bootstrapping approach results are shown in \cref{tab_relaxed_boot_idx}.

We observed that the first approach yields far too few keypoints, due to the matchDescriptor() method. Furthermore, the pure lateral camera motion of dataset Parking suits well this baseline/depth bootstrapping approach, which confirms our intuition given the 'triangulability condition' described in \cref{sec_boot}.\\

Deploying the second approach on the Kitti dataset evidently fails due to the straight camera motion, inhibiting angles ($[0.5, 3.7]$ deg) to reach the desired 10 degrees. As soon as there is a distinctive rotational movement involved, e.g. in Malaga and Parking, a useful bootstrapping is performed.


\subsection{Overall performance}
(keywords: Real time ness, comparison to groundtruth, compare different datasets
Impact of features) Here we describe it such as it runs best in our opinion.

\subsubsection{Key parameters}
\cref{params_table} shows the parameters that worked best for our implementation and led to the results presented. Tuning the datasets was always a tradeoff between speed, accuracy and robustness. The main parameter, that improved trajectory error a lot was the pixel tolerance of the RANSAC. It had to be set to a small value in order to not improve the trajectory and robustness.

\subsubsection{Runtime characteristics}
\cref{runtime_table} summarizes the main runtime characteristics of the different datasets with our pipeline.\\

The \textbf{parking dataset} performed fasted and had the best trajectory. Since we could not perform bundle adjustment, there is a slight drift of the estimated trajectory. However, the scene can also be nicely reconstructed in 3D from the point cloud generated (see \cref{parking_result_fig}).\\

The \textbf{Kitti dataset} starts well but suffers a lot from scale drift also due to missing bundle adjustment and thus summing up errors. However, the first few curves are tackled relatively well.

\subsubsection{speed \& realtimeness}
The parameter with the biggest impact on the frame rate was the number of iterations for the P3P-RANSAC. The frame rate depends almost linearly on this parameter. Further the more landmarks tracked the slower the pipeline. However, we preferred to generate more landmarks over having a faster pipeline in order to increase robustness and accuracy.\\

A profiling run with the Matlab profiler tool showed that most of the computational resources is spent in the following three functions in descendant order (self-time): \code{p3p()}, \code{selectKeypoints()} and \code{harris()}.
