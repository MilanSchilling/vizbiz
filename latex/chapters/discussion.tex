\subsubsection{Pose estimation algorithm}
We investigated pose estimation with DLT refinement after the P3P-Guess and without refinement (using the last P3P guess from RANSAC). It turned out, that very often the P3P-guess was a lot better and especially more robust then the DLT refinement. \cref{parking_result_fig_dlt} shows the estimated trajectory with DLT refinement. It is clearly worse then the P3P estimate as shown in \cref{parking_result_fig}. That's why we used the last P3P guess in our implementation.

\subsubsection{Reinitialization}
@Milan
How often does it happen? Is the result better afterwards?

\subsubsection{Feature work}
A list of potential improvements
@ Milan

Possible future work, improvements (loop closure, ...)

\begin{itemize}
\item bootstrapping with both information rotation through bearing angle diff and translation through baseline/depth ratio
\item $\cdots$
\item Use a parallel for loop for P3P-RANSAC
\end{itemize}
