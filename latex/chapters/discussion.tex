\section{Discussion}

\subsubsection{Correspondence search}
KLT vs Harris matching

\subsubsection{Bundle Adjust}
improvements reached

\subsubsection{Pose estimation algorithm}
DLT refinement vs p3p guess in continuous  maybe not

\subsubsection{Reinitialization}

\subsubsection{Feature work}
What have we learned, what worked?

Possible future work, improvements (loop closure, ...)
\begin{itemize}
\item bootstrapping with both information rotation through bearing angle diff and translation through baseline/depth ratio
\item $\cdots$
\end{itemize}
